# Gase-Search-Engine
Designed and implemented a search engine in Python, to retrieve optimal search results from a restricted data set.

Created a two-layer dictionary to preprocess the database. Data is stored in binary trees, saved as pkl files.

Results are provided by searching the query terms on the binary trees with term frequency as the search criteria.
